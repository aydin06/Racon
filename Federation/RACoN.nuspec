      High Level Architecture (HLA) Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) Abstraction Layer for MS.NET
    </description>
    <summary>
      The RTI abstraction component for MS.NET (RACoN) deals with the High Level Architecture (HLA) runtime infrastructure (RTI) communication in order to access the federation-wide data (actually, the objects and interactions exchanged in federation). RTI is middleware broker software that manages the federation execution and object exchange through a federation execution. The RACoN provides the .NET wrapper classes for the RTI and RTI-specific data structures. As it offers more maintainable, robust, and portable methods, developing an abstraction layer (wrapper) over RTI is a popular approach in many HLA-based projects.
    </summary>
